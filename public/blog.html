      <!-- ======================== POST 1: EWC CODES ======================== -->
      <article>
        <h2>Understanding EWC Codes: A Complete Guide for UK Waste Producers</h2>

        <img src="images/ewc-guide-corrected.png" alt="Understanding EWC codes example" class="blog-image">

        <p>
          European Waste Catalogue (EWC) codes — sometimes called LoW (List of Waste) codes — are the foundation of waste classification in the UK. 
          Every business that produces waste must identify the correct code before the material can be stored, transported, or disposed of legally. 
          Incorrect coding can lead to rejected loads, enforcement action, financial penalties and, in some cases, prosecution.
        </p>

        <h3>Why EWC Codes Matter</h3>
        <p>
          EWC codes exist to ensure that waste streams are classified consistently across Europe and the UK. The six-digit code tells you:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>What type of waste it is</strong> (e.g., construction, municipal, commercial).</li>
          <li><strong>Whether the waste is hazardous or non-hazardous</strong>.</li>
          <li><strong>What regulations apply</strong>, including Duty of Care and consignment requirements.</li>
          <li><strong>Which licensed sites</strong> can legally accept the waste.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Correct Example EWC Codes</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>17 02 01</strong> — Wood from construction and demolition activities (non-hazardous).</li>
          <li><strong>20 03 01</strong> — Mixed municipal waste, commonly produced by businesses and households.</li>
          <li><strong>16 01 03</strong> — Used or end-of-life tyres (Chapter 16: wastes not otherwise specified).</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>How to Identify the Proper EWC Code</h3>
        <p>Follow the government’s recommended three-step process:</p>
        <ol>
          <li><strong>Identify the source activity.</strong> For example, construction, manufacturing, healthcare, ELV dismantling etc.</li>
          <li><strong>Check the chapter and sub-chapter descriptions.</strong></li>
          <li><strong>Identify the correct six-digit code.</strong></li>
        </ol>

        <p>
          If the waste appears in more than one chapter, you must use the chapter relating to the <strong>original process that created it</strong>.
          If you misclassify waste, the receiving site may reject the load or require a revised transfer note before tipping.
        </p>

      <!-- ======================== POST 2: PERMITS ======================== -->
      <article>
        <h2>Environmental Permits: What They Are and Why They Matter for Businesses</h2>

        <img src="images/environmental-permits.png" alt="Environmental permits guidance" class="blog-image">

        <p>
          Environmental permits exist to regulate activities that could pose a risk to human health or the environment.
          They apply to waste sites, treatment activities, energy generation, industrial processes, discharges to water, and many other operations.
          Whether you're buying land, operating a waste site, or establishing new infrastructure, understanding the requirements of environmental permitting is essential to avoid legal and financial pitfalls.
        </p>

        <h3>What an Environmental Permit Covers</h3>
        <p>
          Permits set conditions to ensure that environmental impacts are controlled and adequately monitored.
          These conditions may include:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Limits on storage volumes or waste types.</li>
          <li>Emission monitoring and controls.</li>
          <li>Infrastructure and drainage requirements.</li>
          <li>Record-keeping, reporting and inspection obligations.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Permits and Commercial Transactions</h3>
        <p>
          When buying or leasing a site, undisclosed or incorrectly transferred permits can create major issues.  
          Some businesses assume permits automatically transfer with a property — <strong>they do not</strong>.
          The new operator must apply to transfer, vary, or surrender the permit.
        </p>
        <p>
          During due diligence, always check:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Whether the permit is valid and active.</li>
          <li>Whether the permit matches the activities taking place.</li>
          <li>Compliance history, breaches, warnings or enforcement notices.</li>
          <li>Site plan boundaries vs permitted boundary.</li>
        </ul>

      <!-- ======================== POST 3: CARRIER/BROKER/DEALER ======================== -->
      <article>
        <h2>What Is a Waste Carrier, Broker or Dealer? A Practical UK Guide</h2>

        <img src="images/waste-carrier.png" alt="Waste carrier, broker and dealer roles" class="blog-image">

        <p>
          Many businesses are surprised to learn that simply transporting waste — even their own — can require registration.
          Others do not realise that arranging the transport of waste for someone else (even without physically handling it) may classify them as a waste broker.
        </p>

        <h3>Waste Carrier</h3>
        <p>
          You are a carrier if you transport waste as part of your business.  
          There are two tiers:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Upper Tier</strong> — For most businesses transporting for others.</li>
          <li><strong>Lower Tier</strong> — For organisations transporting their own non-hazardous waste.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Waste Broker</h3>
        <p>
          A broker organises the movement of waste without physically transporting it.  
          For example, logistics coordinators, facilities managers, or skip brokers.
        </p>

        <h3>Waste Dealer</h3>
        <p>
          Dealers buy or sell waste, or act as intermediaries in commercial waste transactions.
        </p>

        <h3>Why This Matters</h3>
        <p>
          Operating without the correct registration can result in:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>£5,000+ fines</li>
          <li>Vehicle seizure</li>
          <li>Prosecution</li>
          <li>Loss of site access</li>
        </ul>

      <!-- ======================== POST 4: DO YOU NEED A PERMIT? ======================== -->
      <article>
        <h2>How Do You Know If You Need an Environmental Permit?</h2>

        <img src="images/permit-needed.png" alt="Do I need a permit?" class="blog-image">

        <p>
          Businesses often assume they don’t need a permit because their activity seems low-risk.
          However, the threshold for requiring a permit is sometimes much lower than expected.
          Failure to obtain one can lead to enforcement notices, stop-work orders and significant fines.
        </p>

        <h3>Common Activities That Require a Permit</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Storing or treating waste above exemption thresholds</li>
          <li>Operating machinery that emits dust, fumes or noise</li>
          <li>Fuel storage or combustion equipment</li>
          <li>Discharging to surface water or groundwater</li>
          <li>Biological waste treatment</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Understanding Exemptions vs Permits</h3>
        <p>
          Some operations can be carried out under an exemption (e.g., T5, S1, U1), but these often include strict volume limitations.
          If you exceed them — even unintentionally — you are automatically operating illegally.

      <!-- ======================== POST 5: DUTY OF CARE ======================== -->
      <article>
        <h2>Understanding Your Waste Duty of Care Responsibilities</h2>

        <img src="images/duty-of-care.png" alt="Duty of Care in waste management" class="blog-image">

        <p>
          Under Section 34 of the Environmental Protection Act 1990, every business has a legal Duty of Care for the waste it produces.
          This means ensuring it is stored, transported, and disposed of safely — and only via licensed carriers and permitted sites.
        </p>

        <h3>Main Duty of Care Requirements</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Correct EWC classification</li>
          <li>Secure on-site storage</li>
          <li>Transfer only to registered carriers</li>
          <li>Keep waste transfer notes for at least 2 years</li>
          <li>Ensure receiving sites are properly permitted</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          Non-compliance can result in enforcement notices, penalties or being held liable for downstream fly-tipping if your waste ends up in the wrong hands.

        <img src="images/unlicensed-carrier.png" alt="Risks of unlicensed waste carriers" class="blog-image">

        <p>
          The UK waste industry still suffers from fly-tipping and illegal waste movements. 
          Many of these incidents originate from unregistered carriers offering "cheap" disposal services.
          Businesses who use them — even unknowingly — can be held partially liable.
        </p>

        <h3>Consequences of Using an Unlicensed Carrier</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Prosecution under Duty of Care law</li>
          <li>Fixed penalty notices</li>
          <li>Costs for clean-up or remediation</li>
          <li>Reputational damage</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>How to Stay Compliant</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Check the carrier on the EA public register</li>
          <li>Request a Waste Transfer Note for every collection</li>
          <li>Ensure EWC codes are accurate</li>

<!-- BLOG POST: WHAT IS A WASTE TRANSFER NOTE -->
<section class="faq-section">
    <div class="faq-item">
        <button class="faq-question">What Is a Waste Transfer Note?</button>
        <div class="faq-answer">
            <p>
                A Waste Transfer Note (WTN) is a legal document required whenever waste changes hands between
                two parties—whether for collection, transport, or disposal. It forms the audit trail proving
                that waste has been managed responsibly and in line with UK legislation under the Environmental
                Protection Act 1990.
            </p>
            <p>
                WTNs apply to most non-hazardous waste, and must be completed for every load unless a
                “season ticket” arrangement is in place for repeat collections. The note records key details
                such as:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Who produced the waste</li>
                <li>Who collected the waste</li>
                <li>The waste carrier registration number</li>
                <li>The EWC code describing the waste type</li>
                <li>The quantity and description of waste</li>
                <li>The collection address</li>
                <li>Where the waste will be taken for treatment</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                WTNs must be kept for a minimum of **two years** and must be available during inspections. 
                Electronic versions (including PDFs or platform-based records) are accepted by regulators.

<!-- BLOG POST: HOW TO CHOOSE A COMPLIANT WASTE CONTRACTOR -->
<section class="faq-section">
    <div class="faq-item">
        <button class="faq-question">How to Choose a Compliant Waste Contractor</button>
        <div class="faq-answer">
            <p>
                Choosing a compliant waste contractor is essential to protecting your business from
                legal risk, financial penalties, and environmental harm. Under UK Duty of Care laws,
                <strong>you are responsible for ensuring your waste is handled by legitimate and licensed operators</strong>.
            </p>
            <p>Before appointing a contractor, you should verify the following:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Waste Carrier Registration</strong> – Check the operator is registered as a carrier,
                    broker, or dealer. You can confirm this directly using the Environment Agency public register:
                    <a href="https://environment.data.gov.uk/public-register/view/search-waste-carriers-brokers" target="_blank">
                        EA Waste Carrier Registration Search
                    </a>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Insurance</strong> – Ensure they have adequate public liability and pollution cover.</li>
                <li><strong>Disposal Routes</strong> – Confirm which sites they tip at and ensure those facilities
                    are fully permitted and suitable for the waste types collected.</li>
                <li><strong>Documentation</strong> – Ensure they provide compliant WTNs or Hazardous Waste Consignment Notes.</li>
                <li><strong>Vehicle Standards</strong> – Check that vehicles are roadworthy, maintained,
                    and suitable for the waste stream.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                A non-compliant contractor exposes your business to prosecution. Always carry out checks,
                keep records, and periodically re-verify licences as they can expire or be revoked.
            </p>
            <p>
                A good contractor will be transparent, willing to provide evidence, and clear about how and
                where the waste is processed. Avoid any company that cannot show documentation.

<!-- BLOG POST: WHAT CHECKS SHOULD YOU DO BEFORE TIPPING AT A WASTE SITE -->
<section class="faq-section">
    <div class="faq-item">
        <button class="faq-question">What Checks Should You Do Before Tipping at a Waste Site?</button>
        <div class="faq-answer">
            <p>
                Before tipping any waste at a disposal or treatment facility, both waste producers and carriers
                have a responsibility to ensure that the site is compliant, permitted, safe, and suitable for
                the waste being deposited. This is a key part of the UK Duty of Care framework.
            </p>

            <h4>Key Checks You Must Carry Out</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Check the site’s permit</strong> – Verify that the facility holds a valid
                    Environmental Permit covering the specific waste types (EWC codes) you are delivering.
                    You can search for permits using:

                        EA Environmental Permit Public Register
                    </a>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Check opening times and restrictions</strong> – Some sites restrict certain
                    waste types, vehicle sizes, or delivery windows.</li>
                <li><strong>Ensure the waste matches the description</strong> – Mixed or contaminated loads
                    may be rejected or incur surcharges.</li>
                <li><strong>Verify safety rules</strong> – Many sites require PPE, induction procedures, or
                    specific access routes.</li>
                <li><strong>Check pricing and acceptance criteria</strong> – Some sites require pre-approval
                    or booking confirmations.</li>
                <li><strong>Confirm duty of care documents</strong> – Ensure your WTN or consignment note
                    is completed and accurate prior to arrival.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>
                A quick verification can prevent rejected loads, delays, or non-compliance issues.  
                Never tip at a site if you are unsure about its legal status or suitability.
